      # This test execution environment uses Appium version 1.9.1 by default, however we enable you to change it using the Appium version manager (avm). An
      # example "avm" command below changes the version to 1.14.2.
      # For your convenience, we have preinstalled the following versions: 1.9.1, 1.10.1, 1.11.1, 1.12.1, 1.13.0, 1.14.1, 1.14.2, 1.15.1 or 1.16.0. Additionally, for iOS, we have also preinstalled the following versions: 1.17.1, 1.18.0, 1.18.1, 1.18.2, 1.18.3, and 1.19.0
      # For iOS Devices on OS version 14.2 and above, please use Appium Version 1.19.0 or higher.
      # For iOS devices on OS version 14.0 and above, please use Appium version 1.18.0 or higher.
      # For iOS devices on OS version 13.4 through 13.7, please use Appium version 1.17.1 or higher.
      # Additionally, for iOS devices on OS version 13.0 through 13.3, please use Appium version 1.16.0 or higher.
