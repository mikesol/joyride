A rhythm game to play with friends and frenemies.

## Local development

Make sure to have a firebase emulator running via `firebase emulator:start`. To install the most recent firebase CLI, please read [these instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli). 

Then, run `npm install && npm start`.

It should "just work". If it doesn't, please file an issue!
